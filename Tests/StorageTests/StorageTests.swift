    Test data for the `LocalStorage` instance so we can test it.

    I could use Lorum Ipsum, or I could just sit here and write jibberish like I am now. It might take long, but oh well.

    Listing to the Piano Guys right now.

    Ok, that should be enough bytes for anyone. Unless we are short of the chunk size. I want enough data for at least two chunks of data.

    # Section 2

    ^><<>@<^<>^<>^<>^<>^<>^<>^<>^ open mouth ðŸ˜®. Hmm, I wonder how that will work
    Maybe if I ran a byte count I could stop typing. But I'm too lazy.

    I hope this is enough.
